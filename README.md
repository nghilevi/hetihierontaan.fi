=================

hetihierontaan.fi belongs to Arabiaan Massage company, located in Helsinki

Developed from Limon theme. The original Limon is an unresponsive theme and quite hard to use for the customer, who is an old woman having little IT skills. My role is modifying the theme to make it more responsive and easy to use.

A site is called responsive when it can provide an optimal viewing experience including easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrollingâ€”across a wide range of devices (from mobile phones to desktop computer monitors).

To help the site achieve its responsiveness, I used media queries in the Style.css file of Limon theme. You can find the source code here: https://github.com/vinhnghi223/hetihierontaan.fi/blob/master/style.css . From there, go to the comment section named RESPONSIVE . From there you can see how the css file has been overwritten. I took into consideration of the following dimensions:

The device with maximum width of 719px (max-width : 719px) suitable for landscape view on most current tablets.
The device with maximum width of 573px (max-width : 573px) suitable for portrait view on most current tablets.
The device with maximum width of 373px (max-width : 373px) suitable for portrait & landscape view on most current mobile phones.

That is not the only change that I made for the theme but it is the main change. I also did some minor alternatives such as changing some other UI factors on the internal dashboard as well as the website UI.
